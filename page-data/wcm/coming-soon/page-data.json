In the next release, we will add enhancements to some of the existing features in Watson Care Manager<!--, and further views to the bring-your-own-tool (BYOT) reporting solution -->.\n\n**Note:** We are actively working on these items, so there might be some changes before the production release. For you to more easily identify the changes that apply to your instance of Watson Care Manager, updates are tagged as follows:\n\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Watson Care Manager</span> - these updates are for all Watson Care Manager customers.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Reporting</span> - these items apply to all Watson Care Manager customers that use Watson Care Manager Reporting.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Service Providers</span> - these items apply to Watson Care Manager customers with the Providers feature enabled.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Organization Units</span> - these updates are for all Watson Care Manager customers with Organization Units enabled.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Community Service Referral</span> - these items apply to customers who have licensed the Watson Care Manager Community Service Referral add-on.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Community Service Payment</span> - these items apply to customers who have licensed the Watson Care Manager Community Service Payment add-on.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Connect Providers</span> - these items apply to customers who have licensed the Watson Care Manager Connect Providers add-on.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Connect Individuals</span> - these items apply to customers who have licensed the Watson Care Manager Connect Individual add-on.\n- <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Connect 360</span> - these items apply to customers who are integrated with the IBM Health and Human Services Connect 360 application.\n\n<!-- ## Coming soon for reporting\n\n### Bring your own tool\n\n<span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Reporting</span>\n\nIn the upcoming release, Watson Care Manager reporting is continuing to expand the views available in the BYOT reporting solution. We are including a new view in the Clinical and Vital category, which groups attributes that relate to a client's waist circumference, such as the measurement number, unit, and status.  \n\nWe are deprecating two views, USERS_V1_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW. We will be removing these views in a future release, and we recommend that you start using their new versions, USERS_V2_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW. We are relabelling the ‘rolename’ attribute to ‘defaultworkspace’ for USERS_V2_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW, to align with the Watson Care Manager application. When you update existing reports or create new reports which contain attributes that relate to USERS_V1_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW, use the new version of these views.\n\nFor the full list of views that are available, see the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/). For details on updates to existing views in the upcoming release, see the Release Notes section on the Data Summary page of the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/guides/datasummary?id=release-notes). -->\n\n## Coming soon Watson Care Manager rebranding\n\nIn the upcoming release (23.04), we will be rebranding Watson Care Manager.\n\nWe are pleased to announce our new product name Merative Integrated Care.\nYou will see the new product name and logo across the following applications from 23.04:\n\n- Core Watson Care Manager\n- Connect Individuals\n- Connect Providers\n\nThe product documentation will be rebranded and available as a downloadable PDF on [Merative Support Docs](https://curam-spm-devops.github.io/wh-support-docs/wcm/product-documentation). We will also be rebranding our [Bring Your Own Tooling (BYOT) Report Data Catalog](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/). No action is needed from you for the rebranding changes in this release.\n\n We also want to let you know there will be a few changes in future releases:\n\n- In the 23.05 release, you will have a new application URL for Merative Integrated Care and for the Connect applications if you use these.\n- In the 23.06 release, there will be a new product documentation site.\n\nMore information will be avilable in the coming weeks.\n\n## Coming soon for administrators\n\n### Subscribing to client registration notifications\n\n   <span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Watson Care Manager</span>\n\nTo allow external systems that are integrated with Watson Care Manager to receive notifications when a new client is registered in Watson Care Manager, we are adding the ability for you to subscribe external systems to client registration notifications. Watson Care Manager sends a notification to the external system about the update (through webhooks) so that the external system can retrieve the latest version of the data through the client registration API.\n\n<!-- ## Coming soon for care teams\n\n### Messaging clients through external messaging\n\n<span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Watson Care Manager</span>\n\nWhen your administrator enables the external messaging feature, a messaging option, like the existing messaging option with the Connect Individuals application, will be displayed to you in the side navigation menu, and a banner notification will be displayed when there are new unread messages from your client. The Message Notifications page will display a list of all unread messages received from clients who are assigned to you. You can view a client’s messages from their Summary page, by selecting Messages on their Summary page. You can send new messages to your clients, which will be delivered to the clients through the external messaging API. You can read or clear the messages as needed, and filtering will be available. -->\n\n## Coming soon for integrations and APIs\n\n### Updating the client registration API to share new client registration data with external systems\n\n<span style=\"background-color: lightblue;\">Watson Care Manager</span>\n\nWe are updating the client registration API so that it can share the new client registration data with an external system. When a new client is registered in Watson Care Manager, the external system can call in to receive details about this client.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"72f93e157d9a38e80165cf30ed220729","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":100},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coming Soon in Watson Care Manager","description":null},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Coming Soon in Watson Care Manager\ndescription: \n---\n\nThis document describes new features and changes that are coming soon in your next update of Watson Care Manager.\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Coming soon Watson Care Manager rebranding</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Coming soon for administrators</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Coming soon for integrations and APIs</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Introduction\n\nTo help you to prepare for upcoming releases, we are excited to give you a preview of what is coming soon in Watson Care Manager.
